        questions.append ( Question( "Massachusetts", " How many ways can you arrange the word Math together in the word Massachusetts? " + "For Example: ssaMathcusets is one arrangement; asscuseMathts is also\n\n\n\n\n Treat Math as a standalone object. Then there are 10 objects to arrange. However there are duplicates of 4s. So apply the general combination formula and you have 10!/4!= 151,200") )
        questions.append ( Question("Birthday Party", " Suppose you are in a unfamiliar class, there is a total of 35  students. What are the chances that there is more than 2 students sharing a common birthday? Common birthday includes month and day only. If you enter 100 of such classrooms, should you bet on them all ?\n\n\n\n The probability of all of them having a different birthday is permutation(365,35)/ 365^35 = 0.1825. So the probablity of them not having a common birthday is 1- 0.1856 = 0.813. You are likely to win the bet, so bet all the time!"   ))

In addition you are certain that score varies around 20%(varience). What is the probability you will earn 90% for your next exam?\n\n\n\n The mean is 70 and varience is 20 here. Using normal standardization for the normal distribution, 90-70/20 = 1. The standard normal distribution table yields 0.84134. So you have 84% chance "))
        
        questions.append( Question("Flipping coins", "You flip 10 coins. What is the probability there will be only 3 heads? \n\n\n\n The probability of heads is 0.5, so binomial(3,10,0.5) = 0.117"))

        questions.append( Question("Bad Grades","In a class of 40 students, there are 10 students that are performing poorly. You chose ten of students randomly. What are the odds that 5 of the selected are performing poorly? \n\n\n The total population is 40. Amount of success in total population is 10. Sample size is 10. You want to have 5 success from sample size. So it will be the hypergeometric distribution. Hypergeometric(5,10,10,40)= 0.04236" ) )
        
        questions.append( Question("Wine bottles","There are ten wine bottles. You can only drink one wine at time and you must finish all of them. In how many ways can you drink them ?\n\n\n\n\n You have 10 wines to choose, followed by 9, followed by 8 ... followed by 1. So it will be 10*9*8 ...*1 = 10!=3628800"))
